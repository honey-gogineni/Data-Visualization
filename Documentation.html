		<h2>Introduction:</h2>
		<p> The cholera epidemic in the nineteenth century was a major global calamity that caused multiple widespread pandemics 
			in European countries. The London area experienced a series of cholera outbreaks during the years of 1848 and 1854 
			that claimed a significant number of lives. In a central London neighborhood called Soho with unsanitary businesses 
			and housing, cholera pandemics have occurred around Broad (now Broadwick Street) Street, Golden Square. 
			Dr. Snow, an obstetrician with expertise in many clinical scientific fields, oversaw pioneering investigations on 
			cholera pestilences in which he demonstrated that tainted water was the primary cause of the illness.
			His thorough investigation of the epidemic led him to the conclusion that the disease was caused by contaminated water
			from the Broad Street siphon, and the removal of the handle caused the pandemic to end. He went on to explain that
			they were using two water supply systems to receive their water, one from a portion of the Thames River that had been
			polluted by sewage and the other that got its water upstream from a section of a stream that had not been poisoned. 
			He created a map of London, water-dispersed frameworks, and examined cholera cases among water users of two different
			suppliers based on their water usage. Members of the appropriation framework using tainted water experienced sickness 
			rates that were significantly higher than those of the organization whose water was supplied above the polluted section 
			of the creek. The goals of the sterilization movement were advanced by this display, which led to the construction of sewage 
			disposal systems and water purification systems in urban areas and towns during the following decades, which reduced the 
			prevalence of cholera and other illnesses. </p>
		<h2>Objective:</h2>
		<p> To regenerate Dr.John Snow's map original map in an interactive version using today's
			tools of trade (D3, to be specific) </p>
		<h2>Design:</h2>
		<p> The requirements and the scope along with the data files such as street coordinates, nearby pumps,
			deaths, age and sex details can be accessed <a href="https://khreda.com/teaching/fall22/H517/project1/">here</a>.
			I started exploring the dataset and tried to understand the data. After familiarizing myself with the data, I started 
			designing my template for the dashboard.
